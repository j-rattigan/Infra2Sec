## 🧩 Roadmap Breakdown

### 🌐 Foundation: Networking Basics _(Beginner → Intermediate)_

> Aim: Build "enough to be dangerous" understanding of networking concepts.

- [ ] Understand OSI & TCP/IP models
- [ ] Common protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP(S), DNS, DHCP
- [ ] What is a firewall? IDS vs IPS
- [ ] Understand IP addressing, subnets, VLANs
- [ ] Basic packet capture (Wireshark)
- [ ] Practice network troubleshooting (ping, tracert, netstat)

**Resources:**
- Cisco Networking Basics on YouTube
- TryHackMe: Network Fundamentals
- Optional: CompTIA Network+ (not essential!)

---

### 🔐 Foundation: Security Fundamentals _(Beginner → Intermediate)_

> Build a strong base in security concepts.

- [ ] CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- [ ] Principles of least privilege, defense in depth
- [ ] Common attack types: phishing, ransomware, DDoS
- [ ] Introduction to threat intelligence (IOCs, TTPs)
- [ ] Basic security terminology: risk, vulnerability, threat, exploit

**Resources:**
- TryHackMe: Cybersecurity Introduction
- YouTube: NetworkChuck Cybersecurity Basics
- OWASP Top 10 (Web app risks — optional intro)

---

### 🖥️ Operating System Hardening & Security _(Intermediate)_

> Build on your existing skills in OS security and hardening.

- [ ] Windows hardening best practices
- [ ] CIS Benchmarks: Windows Server & Workstation
- [ ] Audit policies and event logs
- [ ] Active Directory basics for security
- [ ] Linux basics: file permissions, basic hardening

**Resources:**
- CIS Benchmarks (Free registration)
- Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit
- TryHackMe: Windows Fundamentals
- AD Security: harmj0y blog

---

### ⚙️ Scripting & Automation _(Intermediate)_

> Use PowerShell (your strength!) to automate security tasks.

- [ ] PowerShell: Automate hardening tasks
- [ ] Write scripts for log analysis
- [ ] Use PowerShell to query AD
- [ ] Automate vulnerability scans (e.g., with Nessus or OpenVAS)

**Resources:**
- PowerShell for Cybersecurity (YouTube / Pluralsight)
- PowerShell Empire (Red team optional lab)

---

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Management _(Intermediate → Advanced)_

> Learn how to find, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Understand CVEs, CVSS scoring
- [ ] Use vulnerability scanners (OpenVAS, Nessus Essentials)
- [ ] Patch management strategies
- [ ] Remediation workflows
- [ ] Reporting and risk prioritisation

**Resources:**
- Nessus Essentials (Free)
- OpenVAS (Free)
- TryHackMe: Vulnerability Management

---

### 🧪 Practical Labs & Tools _(Ongoing Practice)_

> Hands-on experience with tools used in the field.

- [ ] SIEM basics (e.g., Splunk free tier, Elastic SIEM)
- [ ] EDR concepts (CrowdStrike / Defender for Endpoint demo)
- [ ] Wireshark: Packet analysis
- [ ] Burp Suite (Community Edition)
- [ ] Sysinternals Suite
- [ ] TryHackMe / HackTheBox labs

**Resources:**
- TryHackMe: SOC Level 1 Learning Path
- Splunk Fundamentals 1 (Free)

---

### 🏅 Certifications (Optional but recommended)

- [ ] Build and document a home lab (Windows AD + Linux VM)
- [ ] Create PowerShell scripts for automation tasks
- [ ] Document CIS hardening benchmarks applied
- [ ] Write a blog post about vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Set up a basic SIEM and log some events!
- [ ] Track progress in this GitHub repo

---

### 🌱 Continuous Learning & Community

> Stay connected and keep learning.

- [ ] Follow security news (KrebsOnSecurity, The Hacker News)
