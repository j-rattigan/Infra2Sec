## 🧩 Roadmap Breakdown

### 🌐 Foundation: Networking Basics _(Beginner → Intermediate)_

> Aim: Build "enough to be dangerous" understanding of networking concepts.

- [ ] Understand OSI & TCP/IP models
- [ ] Common protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP(S), DNS, DHCP
- [ ] What is a firewall? IDS vs IPS
- [ ] Understand IP addressing, subnets, VLANs
- [ ] Basic packet capture (Wireshark)
- [ ] Practice network troubleshooting (ping, tracert, netstat)

**Resources:**
- Free: Cisco Networking Basics on YouTube
- Optional: CompTIA Network+ (but not essential!)

---

### 🔐 Foundation: Security Fundamentals _(Beginner → Intermediate)_

> Build a strong base in security concepts to apply across tools and roles.

- [ ] CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- [ ] Principles of least privilege & zero trust
- [ ] Authentication vs Authorization
- [ ] Basic cryptography: hashing, encryption
- [ ] Understand threat actors & threat modelling
- [ ] Security frameworks: NIST, CIS Controls, MITRE ATT&CK

**Resources:**
- Free: Cyber Security Full Course (Simplilearn / freeCodeCamp)
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (interactive!)

---

### 🖥️ OS Hardening & Security _(Intermediate)_

> Build on your Windows and infra strengths.

- [ ] Windows security baselining (CIS Benchmarks ✅)
- [ ] Understand Group Policy for security
- [ ] Windows Defender & Defender for Endpoint
- [ ] Patch management strategies
- [ ] Linux basics: users, permissions, firewalls (ufw/iptables)
- [ ] Secure configurations for Linux

**Resources:**
- CIS Benchmarks (free!)
- Microsoft Learn: Windows Security

---

### 🧩 Scripting & Automation _(Intermediate → Advanced)_

> Leverage PowerShell strengths for security automation!

- [ ] PowerShell for security automation
- [ ] Write scripts to audit security settings
- [ ] Scheduled tasks for log collection/alerting
- [ ] Basic Python (optional, for wider tooling)
- [ ] Automate remediation tasks

**Resources:**
- PowerShell: "PowerShell for Cybersecurity" (YouTube/Docs)
- Python: "Automate the Boring Stuff" (free)

---

### 🕵️ Vulnerability Management _(Intermediate)_

> Expand your experience with scanning and remediation.

- [ ] Vulnerability lifecycle: identification > assessment > remediation > reporting
- [ ] Tools: Nessus / OpenVAS / Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- [ ] Understand CVSS scoring
- [ ] Reporting vulnerabilities effectively
- [ ] Prioritisation strategies

**Resources:**
- Nessus Essentials (free for learners!)
- CVSS Calculator

---

### 🛠️ Practical Labs & Tools _(Hands-on)_

> Get your hands dirty with real-world tools.

- [ ] Set up a home lab (VirtualBox / Proxmox ✅)
- [ ] SIEM basics (e.g., Splunk / Elastic)
- [ ] IDS/IPS (Suricata / Snort)
- [ ] Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) concepts
- [ ] Packet analysis with Wireshark
- [ ] Explore TryHackMe: SOC Level 1 Path
- [ ] Explore Microsoft Sentinel (cloud SOC)

**Resources:**
- TryHackMe (affordable, guided)
- Splunk Fundamentals 1 (free)

---

### 🎓 Certifications (Optional, Milestones)

> Optional validation for your skills.

- [ ] Microsoft SC-200: Security Operations Analyst ✅ (Highly recommended for your background!)
- [ ] CompTIA Security+ (Good foundation cert)
- [ ] CompTIA CySA+ (More advanced, SOC focus)
- [ ] Azure Security Engineer (if interested in cloud)

---

### 💼 Projects & Portfolio

> Build proof of work for your GitHub or resume!

- [ ] Document home lab setup and configs
- [ ] Create PowerShell security audit script ✅
- [ ] Write up a vulnerability assessment report (lab exercise)
- [ ] Build a mini incident response playbook
- [ ] Document hardening steps using CIS Benchmarks ✅
- [ ] Contribute to open-source security tool (optional, stretch goal)

**Tip:** Use your GitHub repo to log progress, lessons learned, and scripts!

---

### 🔄 Continuous Learning & Community

> Keep skills fresh and connect with others.

- [ ] Join security forums (Reddit r/netsec, TechExams, etc.)
- [ ] Follow threat intelligence feeds (Krebs on Security, etc.)
- [ ] Attend webinars / virtual conferences (BSides, etc.)
- [ ] Consider CTFs (Capture the Flag challenges) for fun

## 🚀 Notes & Reflections

> Use this space to jot down key learnings, thoughts, or progress updates.

- *Example:* "Completed PowerShell security script — posted to GitHub!"
- *Example:* "TryHackMe SOC1 path complete ✅"

---

## 🎯 End Goal Reminder

**Target:** *By end of 2025* (Flexible!)

*Remember: life happens! Progress over perfection. The goal is steady, sustainable learning, not burnout.*
